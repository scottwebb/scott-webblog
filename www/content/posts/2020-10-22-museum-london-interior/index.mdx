I've shared a couple of posts with [exterior photography](/exterior-photography) of Museum London ([2018](/museum-london-ontatio) & [2019](/museum-london-2019)). Since there have been quite a few photos, I broke it up like this and now it's time to share some of the [interior photography](/interiors-photography).

On this interior shoot, I had a Fanshawe College photography student with me named Dominec. 

It was great to have some assistance and be able to discuss aspects of business and the shoot at hand.

The Centre at the Forks renovation to Museum London sure has created an amazing space. I know the museum has already experienced a lot of great events.
