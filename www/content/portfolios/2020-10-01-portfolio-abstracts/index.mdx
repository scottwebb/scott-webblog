## The Backstory

Bright and visually stimulating abstract art created from architectural photographs I’ve shot. 

This art came out of my exploration to create architecture art for a client and now continue to create. If you would like a custom piece created, I do take on commissions. In the meantime, I encourage you to check out the shop, where I put up limited edition prints for purchase. We need art around us.
