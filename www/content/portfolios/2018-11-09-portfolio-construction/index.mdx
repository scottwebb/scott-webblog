excerpt: Put on your hard hat and steel-toed boots as you enter my construction photography gallery. Construction photography doesn’t have to be limited to sub-par smartphone photos. Is there an important milestone happening within construction? Why not capture it with my help. If you’re a construction company, you have an amazing opportunity right now to separate yourself from the competition with professional in-progress images like the ones here.

## My roles
I was part of a design team of two and responsible for the experience strategy and design of the Web and the mobile app (iOS and Android). I produced wireframes, all interfaces and interactions between April 2015 and March 2016.
