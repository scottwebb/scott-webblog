In just a couple of days (April 23rd, 2018), at the  London Convention Centre , The London and St. Thomas Association of REALTORS® will host and celebrate the 2017 Don Smith Commercial Building Awards. If you’re not familiar, this is a biannual reception and awards ceremony recognizing the top commercial, industrial, multi-family and community buildings across the LSTAR region (London and St. Thomas, I believe). 

> “This is a tremendous opportunity to recognize the outstanding talent, innovation and design by the developer, construction and architectural businesses who create these amazing buildings across the region.”— John Geha, LSTAR

The 20 nominees will be judged on how environmentally sensitive the individual buildings were; on design and innovation; and on the extent to which they met a specific developmental need within the broader community. The categories are Commercial (retail and office), Industrial, Multi-family and Institutional (community).The buildings needed to have been completed between August 1, 2015, and July 31, 2017.

Personally, I’d love to see Cornerstone Architecture’s design for  No. 11 Fire Station  to get an award and be recognized for another amazing Fire Station. The  No. 7 Fire Station  by Cornerstone received a Don Smith Commercial Building Award in 2015.
