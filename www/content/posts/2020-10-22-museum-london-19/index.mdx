While I was happy with the original photos I took of [Museum London at the end of 2018](/museum-london-ontario), I was unhappy with the terrible weather we had at the time. I had the intention to return later in 2019 and grab some additional photos to later share with Nicolson Sheffield Architects as a gift.

Shown below, you'll see Museum London went through a few more changes from autumn 2018 to 2019. 

Looking closely, the two trees beside the handrails of the stairs have been removed. The landscaping looks most excellent too!

For these photos, the weather was much more co-operative and the landscaping was still looking spectacular. It's amazing how quickly autumn changed the previous year, but the changes that occurred from 2018 - 2019 were very nice too. I am certain the removal of those trees really helped with the view out to the Thames River from those huge windows!
