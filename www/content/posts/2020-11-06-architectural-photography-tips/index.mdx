Here are some tips I’ve learned over the years of getting the best architectural photography for architects and photographers.

Some tips may be more important for some architectural photographers than others. It may depend on the experience level and general comfortability.

### 1. Scouting for better Architectural Photography

Set up a time for the photographers to scout the location beforehand. You could provide a tour of the site or simply ensure there is enough time for the photographers to go scouting. Scouting helps to build the relationship with the building,  allows the photographer to start framing images within the mind, and helps to gauge light ahead of the shoot.

It all leads to greater images. While scouting, it’s encouraged to capture photos or even videos too. Interestingly, there are times a scouting image can become a final image. The photos will also help with the visualization of the space while not at the location. The photos can be studied and help develop ideas for the photographer.

### 2. Architects and Photographers Create a Shot List

Plan a desired shot list with accompanying documents related to the project, ie floor plans & elevations & perspective renderings you may want to compare photos. Helps with lenses that may be required and preparation. Architects I’ve worked with have expressed how they don’t want to provide a shot list because they trust in the photographer to capture the architecture with their eye and go through their own process for the shoot.

I do recommend trying to convey any building elements that are most important to capture. In my work, I guarantee my work in that I’ll go back to shoot anything that was missed and if not happy with any images, I’ll reshoot until satisfied and happy. Communicating important perspectives or details can help to avoid going back or reshooting.

### 3. Get a Project Contact or Location Contact

If possible, communicate with the project contact to thoroughly have everything clean as close to the shoot date as possible. We have to work with what the conditions are and dirty windows, floors, etc aren’t something we can do much about at the time.

### 4. Arrange for Clearance for those Interior images

Ensure the photographer has clearance to all necessary areas to photograph and details on whom to contact if needed. A clearance badge is a great way option that can help everyone in the facility understand the photographer is allowed to be doing their shooting. Sometimes it looks odd, or suspicious to security as someone with a camera is shooting away on a ladder or large tripod. A smooth shoot is always better.

### 5. Coordinate Lighting for Twilight Photography

In planning the shoot, find out how we could coordinate the building lighting (inside & out) for shooting twilight photos when desired.  [Twilight photos](/twilight-photography)  are extremely impactful but can often require planning to ensure we have lights on for the shots.

Without interior and exterior lighting, architectural photography loses the impact. We want to show how the building comes to life.

The ease of coordinating lighting, for photography during the blue hour, changes depending on the season. In the winter, most buildings are still in use at dusk because of how early the sunsets. It’s typically in Spring/Summer/Fall that we start running into issues because the sun is now setting later and later and buildings may no longer be open.

In these Summer situations, it’s especially important to arrange for some help from the client and the building contact. A lot of lights tend to be motion sensor enabled and we need access or need someone that has access to help go around the building and activate interior lights.

### 6. For The Best Look, Make Sure the Project is Fully Complete

Not everything can or should be fixed in Photoshop. It’s important that the location is as complete as possible and ready for photography. Especially if these are the main images you’ll use for everything from the Portfolio to Proposals and Social Media.

We are not in the business of trying to sell photo editing software. At least that is my position. We want your design to be the focus. We also don’t want your images to have people question them as real or a 3D rendering.

Hide garbage and recycle bins for the day. Put pylons in front of the building or wherever you don’t want cars to park - if allowed.

### 7. Architectural Photography Needs Time and Patience

Give the  [photographer](/about)  a lot of time to shoot the architecture. If you only allow the  [architectural photographer](/)  to shoot between 10 am-12 pm you’ll be very limited in the images you receive. This could be a time of day that is not optimal for shooting parts of the work.

Giving the photographer access for the full day allows them to keep an eye on lighting as it interacts with the architecture. 6 am might be best to shoot an area of the exterior and 4 pm might create the right conditions to shoot some of the interiors.

The scouting can help the photographer in this area, but the photographer may have to spend time waiting for the decisive moment of lighting and building activity to come together. Providing the photographer with as much time (potentially days) as needed gives them time to shoot your desired shot list and also find other vantage points that maybe be of interest too.

### 8. Consider An Assistant or Models

A budget for an assistant that can double as a person to move through as many images as possible is important. It may seem odd at first, but if we can have a few ‘models’ or ‘extras’ with us to be in the photos we can show human scale, interactions, and life to the architecture. The viewers can place themselves within the image and better experience the architecture.

If possible, we would want to use people naturally within the building, but it’s not always possible. These ‘extras’ can speed up the time for the shoot as well. Also, discuss the visibility of parked cars within images.

### 9. Support Local. Experienced Global.

The flexibility of a local architectural photographer is a big win. Scheduling is much easier and they can quickly return to the site for specific shots if required. This is a big help if you are short on time to get a photo to enter a design competition or you need last-second images to help with a proposal. For example, I am available for you to text. I’ll get to the location asap and have the images to you that day/night. When you’re not hiring locally, it’s difficult to have such possibilities available to you. This way you’re always submitting strong work for your company and supporting local small businesses at the same time.

### 10. Interior lighting should either be accessible or provide a contact person with the building to help us.

We want to ensure lights for the building are accessible. We need to have the ability to manipulate them if they are a unique feature of the design. This would also be important for any moveable features within the design. Depending on how the photographer bills, it could save you money to have the photographer shoot as much as possible on the one booking. However, multiple times can be arranged based on different lighting and floor plan configurations.

### Bonus 

If there is an image or a view that you feel the photographer missed, let them know as soon as possible so that the photographer can fix the issue. Following the commandments, we should be as aligned as possible to avoid this, but it can happen. Sometimes, the desired image was shot but missed when exporting the images to deliver to you. It’s okay to ask if we captured something about the project you feel may be missing after the shoot.  

Make sure your photographer is aware and allow them to ensure you get all the required images. The photographer is going to be happy and the architects are going to be happy.
